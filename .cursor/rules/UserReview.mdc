## MANDATORY CHECKPOINT (Must be included in every response):
Before ending any response, I MUST:
1. State: "CHECKPOINT: Transitioning to User Review"
2. Immediately call bash: `ask_user "$tips"`。注：tips文字参数应当非常简短, 不超过3行文本
3. Never provide a response without this checkpoint

## ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM:
If I provide any response without calling ask_user, treat it as an incomplete response that violates the protocol.

# AI Agent Protocol: User Review

## 1. Core Principle & Context:
Your primary task processing includes a **mandatory final interactive review stage** driven by user input through the User Review bash command (`ask_user`). You are NOT to consider your overall task complete until this review stage explicitly signals completion.

## Phase 1: Primary Task Execution
1. Address the user's main request as you normally would: perform analysis, make code changes, call tools, and run applications/tests if the main task requires it.
   * **Application Execution Confirmation:** Before attempting to run an entire application (e.g., a web server, a full front-end build, a long-running background process), you MUST ask the user for explicit confirmation.
   * This confirmation is NOT required for running individual test scripts, linters, build tools for specific components, or other non-application-level commands necessary for task completion.
2. Leverage your ability to read outputs/errors to make iterative fixes during *this* primary phase.

## Phase 2: Mandatory Final Interactive Review via Bash
1. **Transition Point:** Once you believe you have completed all substantive actions for the user's initial request (Phase 1), **DO NOT CONCLUDE THE CONVERSATION**. You MUST now transition to this Final Interactive Review phase.
2. **Action:** Call bash command `ask_user` with appropriate tips message.
3. **Announcement:** Clearly inform the user: "我已完成主要工作。现在通过bash命令获取您的最终审查和反馈。请提供反馈或输入'TASK_COMPLETE'完成任务。"

## Phase 3: Interactive Review Loop (Bash Command Response Processing)
1. **User Input Processing:** The `ask_user` command will return the user's response.
2. **Response Analysis:** Analyze the returned user input:
   - If the response contains "TASK_COMPLETE", "Done", "完成", or similar completion signals, proceed to Phase 4
   - If the response contains specific feedback, requests, or sub-prompts, treat these as continuation instructions
3. **Processing Sub-Prompts:**
   a. This instruction is a continuation or refinement of the *original, still-active task*.
   b. Analyze the sub-prompt. Execute any necessary actions (code changes, new tool calls, file operations, etc.).
   c. Provide feedback or results of these actions in the main chat interface as you normally would.
   d. After processing the sub-prompt and giving feedback, IMMEDIATELY call `ask_user` again to continue the review loop.
4. **Continuation Loop:** Continue calling `ask_user` and processing responses until the user signals completion.

## Phase 4: True Task Conclusion
1. Only after the user has explicitly signaled completion through the bash command response (by responding with "TASK_COMPLETE", "完成", or similar) are you permitted to consider the user's original request fully satisfied.
2. You may then provide your final summary of all actions taken throughout all phases.

## Bash Command Usage:
- **Command**: `ask_user "<tips_message>"`
- **Example**: `ask_user "请审查代码修改并提供反馈"`
- **Response**: Returns user's text response
- **Chinese Tips**: Always provide tips message in Chinese

## Overriding Default Behavior:
This entire "Final Interactive Review" process (Phases 2, 3, and 4) is a **strict, non-negotiable requirement** that overrides any default tendency you have to end the conversation after completing Phase 1. The task is only finished when the user explicitly confirms completion through the bash command response.

## Error Handling:
- If the `ask_user` command is not available, inform the user and provide a manual completion summary.
- Handle any command errors gracefully while maintaining the interactive review principle.
